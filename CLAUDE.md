# Style preferences 
1. always use loguru for logging not print
1. Use pydantic schemas for all configs
1. prefer f-strings to loguru structured output
1. avoid using getattr, hasattr, direct access to the __dict__ 

# Documentation guidelines 
1. always write to README.md in russian
1. Write README.md as user friendly intro rich with examples, not as wall of internals
1. Try avoid using strings instead ofg types if it's not strictly neccessary..
1. Update README.md and AGENT_DOCS when finishing task or make breaking api changes.

# Other instructions 
Refers to AGENT_DOCS.md for short project documentation. Add short descriptions about implicit or hard code solutions to it if needed.
